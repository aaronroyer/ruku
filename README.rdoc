= Ruku -- Ruby Rokuâ„¢ set-top box remote

== Installation

  gem install ruku

== Usage

The following launches the web interface. See it at http://localhost:3030

  ruku --web

You can use this to scan for boxes and start controlling them. I recommend
using the keyboard (super snappy controlling!). Arrow keys (and vi directional
keys) work, Space plays and pauses, Enter selects, and Esc is home.

You can also just use the command line. Ruku needs to know about your Roku
box(es). If you haven't found any boxes with the web interface, try:

  ruku scan

This will try to scan your network to find boxes. Read on below if it didn't.
Assuming you have a least one box set up, you can start sending commands.

  ruku pause   # Play/pause
  ruku left
  ruku up
  ruku select
  ruku fwd     # Fast forward
  ruku back    # Rewind

Known commands are: up down left right select home fwd back pause

If scanning doesn't work for adding boxes then you'll have to figure out what
the hostname or IP address of a box is (the hostname usually starts 'NP-').
Then add it manually:

  ruku add HOSTNAME_OR_IP

Any method of adding boxes creates a '.ruku-boxes' file in your $HOME directory
that contains an IP or hostname per line (followed optionally by a colon and a
nickname for that box). You can edit or create this yourself. You can see all
known boxes with:

  ruku list
